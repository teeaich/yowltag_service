prototype chain

- generate random location data with turf.js
- save the gejson in file
- import the file in google maps

- is it possible to enhance the geojson with meta data?
- do some tests with the generated location points to find other points within area with the help of turf.js

- install dynamodb-geo to enhance the db with geospartial functions
- check how to generate the db schema with serverless instead of the example script of the library
- is it possible to save the generated data of turf.js into the dynomadb?


save location (newLocation)
 preparaions:

 array of coodinates for hexagon is saved in DB


 - catgorize the location to a grid (dont know how, iterate over every feature polygon is not he solution)
 - save the location with the meta information about the hexagon information in DB

 get all interesting locations (newLocation)

 - query locations
   - filter for hexagon 
   - filter for tags
   -> collection of locations

check for nearest points (filteresLocations)
- build circular shape with specific radius 
- check which filteresLocations are in the circular area
-> collection of locations which are interesting , matching tags and within radius of user
